# Support for FTX-US for package vdbelt/ftx-php
This package aims to implement the FTX-US.com REST API endpoints.

## Installation
You can install the package via composer:
```bash
composer require jjpost86/ftxus-php
```

This library is not hard coupled to Guzzle or any other HTTP library. It follows PSR-18 client abstraction. You'll need to install your own preferred client.

If you want to get started quickly:
```bash
composer require jjpost86/ftxus-php php-http/curl-client nyholm/psr7
```
